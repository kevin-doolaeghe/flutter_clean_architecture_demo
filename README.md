## The Clean Architecture

### The SOLID principles

* **S**ingle responsibility principle (SRP): there should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
* **O**penâ€“closed principle (OCP): software entities [...] should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* **L**iskov substitution principle (LSP): functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
* **I**nterface segregation principle (ISP): cllients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.
* **D**ependency inversion principle (DIP): states to depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes.
